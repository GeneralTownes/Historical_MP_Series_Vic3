 wine_blight_evt.1.d:0 "The Great Wine Blight was a severe blight of the mid-19th century that destroyed many of the vineyards in Western Europe and laid waste to the wine industry."
 wine_blight_evt.1.f:0 "It was caused by an aphid that originated in North America and was carried across the Atlantic in the late 1850s. The actual genus of the aphid is still debated, although it is largely considered to have been a species of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, commonly known as grape phylloxera."

 potato_blight.1.d:0 "A mysterious sickness has infested the potato crops in our country. This could spell immense misery and disorder in the near future"
 potato_blight.1.f:0 "The European Potato Failure was a food crisis caused by potato blight that struck Northern and Western Europe in the mid-1840s. The time is also known as the Hungry Forties. While the crisis produced excess mortality and suffering across the affected areas, particularly affected were the Scottish Highlands and, even more harshly, Ireland.

Between 1845 and 1855, at least 2.1 million people left Ireland, primarily on packet ships but also on steamboats and barques—one of the greatest exoduses from a single island in history."

 potato_blight.7.d:0 "The blight has finally abandoned our soil, yet much discontent remains. The people's collective trauma has hardened them and led many to demand change."
 potato_blight.7.f:0 "In 2019, researched found that the blight was caused by HERB-1, which had originated in the Americas sometime in the early 19th century before spreading to Europe in the 1840s. HERB-1 was responsible for the Great Famine and hundreds of other potato crop failures around the world. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that improvements in crop breeding yielded potato varieties that proved resistant to HERB-1 that the infection was stopped in its tracks. Scientists believe that the HERB-1 strain is now extinct."
