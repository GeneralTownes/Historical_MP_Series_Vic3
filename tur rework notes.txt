rework veiled protectorate to give je to all european gps, make sure veiled protectorate isnt OP

*new egyptian earlyy modernization je

--rule of muhammed ali

*tur changes

--start on free trade - unique law
	--je to reform trade practices


*make new oriental crisis

--add new je with explanation for tur and egy
	--new flavor: 
		conditions for tur/egy to get minor buffs (and weaken each other? undecided on this)
		ability for gps to send support to either side without directly intervening
			--cost of temporary -1 interest while buildup is active, if chosen to support
		possibility of diplomatic solution, preferable for egypt, hurts tur
			--egypt will get a great boost for peaceful independence
			--tur will have outbreak of nationalist protests in jingoist states/cultures, worsens decline
		gps that heavily support egy/tur get increased influence in country (will add when foreign influence exists)
		
		
		

--order of new events
 1. --on builup start
		-tensions in the orient - warns relevant gps they should be prepared for crisis/explains flavor
		-during buildup: one or two events per relevant gp to influence/support either side
	
 2. --on buildup end
		-tur event 
			-option to start diplo play for take puppet, large infamy, most difficult option, best reward (will annex levant states)
			OR
			-option to start diplo play for take states in levant, medium infamy, medium diiculty
			OR
			-option to not start a war, easiest option, bad for tur (short term)
 3. --if diplo play starts
		-event that auto declares interest in relevant region for involved gps
	--if diplo play goes to war
		-if play war for puppet: egy gets minor buff to help them not get owned
		-possible bad event for egy and tur, if they are heavily pushed back or lose capital
		
 4. --when crisis ends (whether war happened or not)
		-possible endings
			-if egy has lost nothing and is independent, tur gets bad event
			-if egy has lost levant, egy gets bad event (add later flavor for egy to reconcile/war with tur)
			-if egy is puppet of tur, tur will receive option to annex levant (cannot annex entirety of egypt)
		-gps will receive an event if their side won, giving influence (when it exists) and prestige
	


random idea - look into expanding the global gdp/state gdp overview screens, moving button, reworking ui to show i.e
most productive state industry, highest gdp contributor, per state per capita for each class? after tur rework
